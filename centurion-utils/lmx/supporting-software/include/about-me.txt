This directory contains the header files for LMX.  These files
are common to all platforms.

Once initial installation is complete they may need to be
relocated to a location more appropriate to your build
environment.

The LMX code generator will generate code that includes the
files lmxuser.h, lmxinternals.h and lmxtypes.h in the correct 
places.  Therefore, in .cpp files that do not call the generated 
marshal() and unmarshal() methods you only need to #include the 
generated header file.  You will need to #include lmxparse.h 
in .cpp files that call the marshal() and unmarshal() methods.

Modifying lmxuser.h will allow you to adjust how the LMX code
works.  See the documentation (lmx-start.html) for more information
on this.
