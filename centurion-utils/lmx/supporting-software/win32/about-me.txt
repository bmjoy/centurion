This directory is the default target destination for the Win32 library files
built from the Supporting Software source code contained in the
supporting-software/src directory.

See supporting-software/src/about-me.txt and
supporting-software/src/build-libs.bat for details on how to build these
files.

The file names of the compiled files have the form:

	lmx-<build type>-<compiler>.lib (or .dll)

For example:

	lmx-MT-vs2017.lib

The <build type> part of the name follows the build switches used by the 
Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.  These are:

	MD - DLL
	MDd - Debug DLL
	MT - Multi-threaded
	MTd - Debug multi-threaded.

The <compiler> part of the name is as follows:

	vs2017 - Microsoft Visual Studio 2017

To select a particular lib for your build, simply add it to your 
project using the IDE.

The header files for Win32 are the same as for the other builds and
are located in the supporting-software/include directory.
